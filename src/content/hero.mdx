I'm a Sr. Front-End Engineer at [Medallia](https://www.medallia.com/), building their surveys platform and helping them shape the customer experience market with React.

I also volunteer as Mentor at [TechLabs Berlin](https://techlabs.org/), a completely free platform for people to learn different programming skills.

Other than this, I'm casually speaking, writing, traveling & advocating for craft brewing.
