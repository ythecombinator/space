Hi, thanks for looking at my speaker rider!

## Accommodations

No part of the cost of speaking at your event should lie with the speaker. You should cover at least:

- My ticket to the event;
- Lodgings in an Airbnb or hotel near the venue the **nights before and after the event**;
- Travel to and from the event, such as flights or trains.

## Fees and Honorariums

Since speaking at events helps me promote myself, I do **not** generally require a speaking fee or an honorarium. This is especially true for non-profits, community events, or events where the cost of attending is heavily reduced.

For large-scale corporate events where the organizing company stands to make a profit or private internal corporate events, my fee is negotiable based on the size of the event and whether I am a keynote speaker.

## Accessibility

### In-Person

If the event is in-person, all areas -including any auxiliary events like official afterparties or co-located events- must be accessible to those who require mobility aids, including stages.
They should adhere to at least the hosting country's equivalent of [ADA standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americans_with_Disabilities_Act_of_1990).

### Virtual

All online services necessary for the event, including its website and any video platforms, should be usable by users who with limited or no eyesight, hearing, and/or mobility.
Any website created by the event should conform to [WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref) by the date of the conference at Level A and at least mostly at AA.

## Code of Conduct

Your event must have an explicitly defined, enforced Code of Conduct linked publicly on your event's website, preferably as a top-level menu item.
It should include a clear, readable description of what behavior is and is not acceptable, as well as at least one way for someone to report a violation.

If you're looking for inspiration, a few good examples are:

- [CNCF](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md)
- [TSConf](https://tsconf.io/code-of-conduct)
- [Rust Community](https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct)
