I am a Front-End Engineer focused on new and scalable technologies based in
Prague. Being a consultant I have shipped solutions to small, medium and huge
companies to grow their business and, mostly, help them meet their business
goals, without leaving quality aside.

My passions are the design and implementation of front-end projects, open-source
stuff and evangelizing cool technologies. I also try to be as active as possible
in local communities and I really like to bring new stuff to where I'm invited
to speak.

## Things I can do

I love exploring new territory, so I'm always looking for challenges related to
any of my current areas of interest:

- Front-end Performance Optimization
- Scalable Architecture Patterns
- Developer Tooling
- Functional and Reactive Programming
- User Interaction Design

Some technical keywords include:

- JavaScript, TypeScript, and Swift
- React, Preact, Next.js, and Gatsby.js
- styled-components, emotion, glamor and just about any CSS-in-JS library
- redux and related tooling (e.g. redux-saga, redux-act, reselect, etc.)
- Bundlers and bundle optimization techniques

Here is what I can offer you:

- Performance analysis of your application and a plan to perfect it
- Performance improvement of build pipelines and frontend tooling
- Building web and mobile applications
- Building tools and processes to improve developer experience on your team
- Refactoring and modernization of legacy code
- Training on web semantics, JavaScript and CSS, React and pull request
  etiquette
- Engineering leadership, mentoring and hiring
- Technical writing
