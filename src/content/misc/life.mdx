I was born in 1998 in Fortaleza, Brazil 🇧🇷.

After graduating from High School, I decided I wanted to be an expert in
building User Interfaces, so I set my mind on mastering web and mobile
technologies.

I spent countless hours architecting, implementing and optimizing applications
for the companies I worked for as well as evenings hacking side projects.

I've also always been excited about sharing what I know with others. When I was
in sophomore in High School, I signed up to present about Git for some of my
classmates and ever since I was a speaker at the many meetups I attended.

I've now delivered dozens of talks on topics including JavaScript/TypeScript,
React, Performance, Programming Languages, and more.
