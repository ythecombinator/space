A wise man once said: "React is such a good idea that we will spend the rest of the decade continuing to explore its implications and applications”.

In 2017, React Fiber was the thing in the community. In 2018, hooks – and the completely new mindset they brought along – took that role with a little help of Concurrent React.

But there are a few other big things happening out there: React Fire, React Flare and the Scheduler. These go from completely rethinking the event system to bringing cooperative scheduling to the browser environment, and much more!

In this talk, we’ll look at what are these, how they fit together with other changes and, hopefully, by the end of the talk, you"ll be just as enthusiastic as I am about what"s coming down the line.

Last but not least, we"ll take a glimpse into the future of the Web platform.
