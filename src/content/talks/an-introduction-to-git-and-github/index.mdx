This talk I will present a brief introduction to the concept of software versioning and its importance. There will be also presented the famous versioning control system created by [Linus Torvalds](https://github.com/torvalds) ([Git](https://git-scm.com/)) and the well known _social network for programmers_, [Github](https://github.com/), showing its importance to our professional career nowadays.
