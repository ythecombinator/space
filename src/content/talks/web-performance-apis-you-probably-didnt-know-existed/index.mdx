Responsiveness to user interaction is crucial for our apps and you’ve probably heard about the amazing tools we have to measure web performance. Maybe you've measured your app using Lighthouse, checked the cost of a package using Bundlephobia, or even rejected a PR that adds a massive dependency using size-limit.

Unfortunately, users are still frustrated by delayed TTIs, high input latency, and janky animations, and, while developers can measure some aspects of responsiveness, sometimes these are not reliable and it’s difficult to identify the root causes.

But did you know there are many performance APIs native to the Web Platform? In this talk, we’ll see how to leverage the power of some of them to reliably measure responsiveness and correctly identify culprits for bad experiences.
