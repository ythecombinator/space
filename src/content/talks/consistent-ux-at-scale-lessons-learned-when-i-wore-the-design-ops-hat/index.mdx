The need for Design Systems comes with the need for scale, efficiency, and consistency in Design. Those have been one of the major talking points in the design community for the past years. Some love it; some are more skeptical.

My goal for this one is to present a case of bringing a few homegrown UI kits together to automatize and standardize UX across applications while sparing our developers from having to deal with tons of CSS.
