In this talk I'll share some of the experiences I had while working on [Conf App Boilerplate](https://github.com/devevents/conf-app-boilerplate) - which aimed to be used to develop the [Front In Fortaleza mobile app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.devevents.frontinfortaleza) in _two weeks_. You'll see how we used trending technologies like [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/), [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/), [Typescript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) - and many others -, to help our code gain in aspects of readability and maintainability - and our team, productivity.
