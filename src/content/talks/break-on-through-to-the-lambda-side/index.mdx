We will see how old concepts of functional programming can make a huge difference nowadays for JS developers through [LiveScript](http://livescript.net/): a preprocessor which brings many syntax enhancements and other features and became a great alternative to start in the functional world. After this _NUG-CE_ - equipped with _first-class functions_, _high-order functions_, _currying_, _composition_, _pipes_ and other things - you'll probably never write the same code again.
