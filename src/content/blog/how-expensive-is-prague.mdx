### Preamble

There's a recent trend amongst expat Brazilian developers in Twitter where they share their cost of living in their current cities.

I initially decided to follow the trend because:

- I think the type of content is super valid for those who want to live abroad. Especially those coming from quite different realities, like Latin America, Asia and Middle Eastern, and others.
- There is a lot of misinformation about the cost of living as an expat spread through Instagram Reels and TikTok out there that try hard to romanticize life abroad at any cost.
- I myself wish I had something similar before I moved here and, even though I had planned my move here, I ended up being surprised by overall costs here and how much my purchasing power dropped for a while after moving.

Before we start, just a little bit of context:

1. I was born and raised in Fortaleza, Brazil. I already worked remotely abroad before coming here, living there.
1. I moved with my wife. Nowadays we have a chihuahua.
1. I am not an EU citizen and I work on a work permit here.

Here we go: my cost of living in Prague, Czech Republic.

Sometimes it's harder to reason about costs when you're coming from a currency with a whole other order of
magnitude. That was a challenge for me coming from BRL to CZK.

As a matter of fact, it was one of the biggest
feedback others and I got when first sharing this kind of post over Twitter.

For that, I am making this post
(originally written in `CZK`) also available in the following currencies: [USD](?currency=USD), [EUR](?currency=EUR), [GBP](?currency=GBP), [JPY](?currency=JPY) and [BRL](?currency=BRL).

### üè† Renting

Renting a flat in the center of Prague‚Äîas well as almost any European capital‚Äîwill sound insanely expensive for anyone coming from prette much any city in Latin America and, in my opinion, one just can't compare the baseline here.
Just like several other expats, when I arrived my company ([STRV](https://www.strv.com)) arranged a short-term flat for 30 days. This flat was around 50m¬≤, the layout was what they call `2 + kk` (explanation below) and it was located in [Invalidovna, Prague 8](<https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invalidovna_(Praha)>).

The building in particular (and the neighborhood as a whole) had several pros:

- Close to a metro station and a cable car/bus stop;
- Close to Karlin, the district where my company's office and several others were located (kind of like one of the tech hubs here in Prague);
- Pubs and caf√©s all around;
- The building itself was mostly inhabited by expats and thus the staff spoke English, which made life a lot easier.

We decided to stay in this building/district. After the 30 days, we managed to move into a studio (~30m¬≤) in the same building while we waited for a larger apartment to be vacant (the same as the one the company had picked up for me).

After about four/five months, we got that one for <Price amount={23700}/>/month, which included internet (<Price amount={300}/>) and all utilities for two people (<Price amount={3000}/>).

The pandemic came and we realized the two of us could us some more space in an apartment. That was also when Ricardo joined our family and we had to find another apartment because that one had internal rules against pets.

In mid-2020, we found ourselves in Prague 10, this time in a very residential area (Vr≈°ovice), in a 95m¬≤ flat and paying <Price amount={25000}/>/month (utilities included). The price per Sqm was way lower than the previous one, mostly because:

- it was a more remote neighborhood,
- it had no subway stations nearby, and
- the building style was from the Czechoslovak era.

At the end of 2021, the owner of that apartment passed away and his family present us a leave notice.

And we moved again! This time, we headed to Prague 2 ([Nov√© Mƒõsto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Town,_Prague)), to a central quarter and got a 90m¬≤ flat.

We started at <Price amount={26500}/> + utilities and in November 2023 we had our first adjustment. We're now settled at <Price amount={30750}/>.

To recap, our experience so far has been:

#### 2019-20 (Prague 8):

- Modern construction (late 2000s);
- Tech bubble area.

    As a matter of fact, the [great
    flooding](https://praguemorning.cz/20-years-after-the-floods-karlin-undergone-transformation-and-further-development-awaits)
    that hit Prague in August 2002‚Äîwhen certain areas of the Czech capital were almost completely submerged and various
    historic monuments damaged‚Äî, affected in particular the district of Karl√≠n.

#### 2020-21 (Prague 10):

- [Czechoslovak-era housing estate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panel%C3%A1k) building;
- Brand new refurbished flat;
- Residential neighborhood.

#### 2022-Now (Prague 2):

- [Post-WWI cubism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rondocubism) building;
- Brand new refurbished flat;
- Kind of part of the historic center of modern Prague.

If I had to summarize some key points to keep in mind when considering renting a flat in Prague, I'd say:

- The apartment layout model (`2+kk`, `3+1`, `4+kk`, `4+1`, etc.) and the [real estate terminology](https://www.flatio.com/blog/1-kk-2-1-how-to-understand-czech-real-estate-terminology) here.
- The correlation between the [distribution of metro stations and the price per square-meter](https://www.valuo.cz/ceny-bytu-na-metru). This probably applies to several other capitals here in Europe.
- The fact that, in general, renting is more expensive than buying a home due to mortgage rates being cheaper than renting. A [study](https://www.asociacenajemnihobydleni.cz/aktuality/najemni-bydleni-zustava-nadale-ekonomicky-vyhodnejsi-nez-vlastnicke) published in January 2024 by the _Rental Housing Association_ (ANB) has found that the average monthly mortgage payment for a 53-square-meter-apartment is half the cost of average monthly rent in Czechia. By the way, I'd say things are like that in much of Europe too!
- The importance of having some cash flow to afford a one/two months deposit and possibly a real estate commission too. This can vary for the better (e.g. no commission, if you rent directly from the owner) or for the worse (e.g. commission plus three months deposit). In other cities/countries here the reality is worse.

### ‚ö° Utilities

I've seen very different models when it comes to this.

There are some arrangments where heating, water and electricity are included in the rent.
In my current apartment, water is included in my monthly rent. I also pay a fixed monthly deposit of <Price amount={1500}/> for electricity.
Last but not least, there's a variable quarterly deposit for heating. I've seen it ranging from <Price amount={2590}/> to <Price amount={4840}/>.

Overall, the calc here is annual, based on average usage: if you used more, you pay the difference, if you used less, you get your money back.

### üõú Connectivity

I'd say that internet here is relatively cheap if compared to Brazil.
I have a `250mb` plan from Vodafone for <Price amount={700}/>/month.
I've also had optical fiber internet for similar rates but unfortunately this setup isn't available in my current area.
I did notice that neighborhoods within (or nearby) the historic center share the same issue with fiber internet coverage.
I've also had plans from T-Mobile and O2 for similar rates.

In addition, I also have a 5G-based redundancy (unlimited data) for home internet that costs <Price amount={900}/>/month.
This is quite useful when my main network drops during a meeting, for example.

For cell phones, my wife and I have T-Mobile plans that go around <Price amount={1100}/> each and provide unlimited data/calls here and an additional `36GB` + `100 mins` within the EU.

### üöã Transport

Public transport here is insanely efficient.
The Prague network is generally one of the highest ranked in Europe. It's simply well covered, cheap and easy to navigate.
[Rates](https://pidlitacka.cz/en/pricing) are split into short-term and season tickets.

It costs me pay <Price amount={3650}/> for unlimited riding the entire network
(buses, cable cars, metro lines, boat, city trains, the funicular, etc.) within Prague for _a whole year_.

By the way, it also happens that some companies include an annual pass as part of their benefits package.

I myself have never checked the prices of bicycles, electric bikes and scooters, but
I've rented them a few times via apps here and it's quite affordable.

I don't have much idea about the costs of a car either, but I have a few friends who own one and it seems much more affordable than in Brazil.
I have to say that most of them have small children and/or like to hit the road for the weekend to visit some country nearby.

### ü©∫ Health Care

In general, the public health system ([VZP](https://www.vzp.cz)) has your back if you're either a Czech/EU citizen or if you're formally under an employment contract here, which is my case.

Unlike some other EU countries, spouses are not covered‚Äîwhich was a negative surprise. My wife, for example, had to pay for a private system ([PVZP](https://www.pvzp.cz)) for a long time. A good plan goes around <Price amount={3000}/>/month.

You'll mostly be fine with VZP/PVZP, but there are also some private healthcare clinics for those looking for more comfort/convenience‚Äîand that includes, for example, being assisted by doctors who speak English.

We lived our first few years here without it but nowadays this is really key to me. Many companies include this in the bonus package.
A monthly subscription in [Canadian Medical](https://www.canadian.cz/en/membership) goes around <Price amount={2990}/>.

### üê∂ Pets

For those into pet parenting, I'd it's quite ok too.

I spend around <Price amount={1300}/> on a 6kg dog food package every quarter.

We pay for a health plan that costs <Price amount={810}/>/month. The plan is very worthwhile, especially in cases of hospital admissions, expensive exams/sampling, etc.
One-off vaccines cost in the range of <Price amount={800}/>-<Price amount={1200}/>.

A two hours visit to a fancy pet shop, with everything included, costs around <Price amount={1000}/>.

### üçª Going Out

This does vary a lot, but in general I'd say it's way cheaper than most western/northern European capitals and more expensive than cities further east.

A pint of craft beer in a good bar costs around <Price amount={70}/>. For about <Price amount={400}/> you can drink a lot and really good quality beer.

Food costs are also within a huge range, but I'd say grabbing lunch costs at least <Price amount={180}/>.
About <Price amount={280}/> will get you lunch at a really decent restaurant.
A dinner at a fancy place goes around <Price amount={450}/>/<Price amount={500}/>per person‚Äîand you'll eat really well!

### üõí Groceries

This is probably the most variable part of the equation because it takes countless factors into account.

My wife and I usually make a one-shot order in the range of <Price amount={4000}/> at the begingging of every month
and then we buy other items on demand.
Much of this can be covered with a company meal voucher (usually at <Price amount={3000}/>/month).

At the end of the month, groceries usually go around <Price amount={8000}/> - <Price amount={9000}/>/month for the two of us.

### üí∞ Salary Ranges

I won't disclose my salary here but from what I've noticed in the local market, I'd say that
the average salary for a senior engineering position here is <Price amount={130000}/> - <Price amount={150000}/>/month.

People in tech positions are considered high skilled workers and these numbers do not reflect the reality of most people here.
In fact, looking at some [recent data from the statistics office](https://czso.cz/csu/czso/ari/average-wages-2-quarter-of-2023),
the average gross monthLY salary in Czechia is around <Price amount={43193}/>.

Taxes are based on how much you earn. There are [great tools](https://www.platy.cz/en/calculator) out there to help you estimate your netto salary.

### Wrapping Up...

I'm not quite sure if I managed to cover everyone's questions around costs of living here, but
I'm always open to anyone who's got questions about career and life as an expat.

Last but not least, this is an ever-living posts and I'll keep updating it as I get more feedback and/or updates to share.
