As I started working as a remote developer (~ early 2018) besides traveling a lot more through my homeland, I decided to travel and live a little around the world for a while – not staying for too long on any city.

Other activities include:

- Mapping coffee shops around the city ☕
- Going for a beer with my mates 🍻
- Trying some different activities (e.g. skydiving, scuba diving, and hiking) 🤘
- Capturing special moments with instant film 📷
- Listening to basically all genres of music I can think of 🎶
- Finding new places to watch the sunset 🌇
- Gathering friends and family by the beach 🏖️
- Being #1 fan of my lovely wifey, Jheniffer 💑
