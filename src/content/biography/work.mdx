I am a Front-End Engineer focused on new and scalable technologies based in Prague. Being a consultant I have shipped solutions to small, medium and huge companies to grow their business and, mostly, help them meet their business goals, without leaving quality aside.

My passions are the design and implementation of front-end projects, open-source stuff and evangelizing cool technologies. I also try to be as active as possible in local communities and I really like to bring new stuff to where I'm invited to speak.

# Things I can do

I love exploring new territory, so I'm always looking for challenges related to any of my current areas of interest:

- Front-end performance optimization
- Scalable architecture patterns
- Developer tooling
- Functional and Reactive Programming
- User Interaction design

Some technical keywords include:

- JavaScript, TypeScript, and Swift
- React, Preact, Next.js, and Gatsby.js
- styled-components, emotion, glamor and just about any CSS-in-JS library
- redux and related tooling (e.g. redux-saga, redux-act, reselect, etc.)
- Bundlers and bundle optimization techniques

# Experience

- React
- redux and related tooling
- Lighthouse, size-limit, and other performance measuring tools
