title: "The Day I Reverse Engineered a Gameboy Advance Game (Revisited)"
---

### Description

> Improved version of [this one](/talks/the-day-i-reverse-engineered-a-gameboy-advance-game).

Gameboy Advance was one of the most popular video game platforms of its time and, because of it, many people worked together as a community to study and to document its architecture and develop ROM hacking and other interesting tools.

It turns out that this video game is a fantastic way to start studying reverse engineering: its architecture is very well documented and simpler if compared to the current game console generation – and, of course, it is very fun to work in a game-related project.

So... what do you think of learning reverse engineering through this challenge: developing a level editor for a GBA game called "Klonoa: Empire of Dreams"?
We need to understand the architecture behind ARM hardware, apply reverse engineering in order to discover how the logic of the game works, and then use our front-end knowledge (JS + React.js) to build a level editor.
