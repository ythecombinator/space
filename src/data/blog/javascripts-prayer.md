summary: "A JavaScript's Prayer"
---

Our JavaScript which art in v8,

Hallowed be thy data types.

Thy prototypes come,

Thy will be done in ES6,

As it is in ES5.

Give us this day our daily promises.

And forgive us our TypeErrors,

as we forgive our syntax sugared code.

And lead us not into 404, not in npm registry

but deliver us from broken builds and errors:

For thine is the classes,

the spreads, and the template strings,

Forever and ever.

Amen.
